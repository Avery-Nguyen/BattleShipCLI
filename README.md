# BattleShipCLI
A simple two-player console application of the classic game, Battleship (written in Javascript). Currently the game only runs locally so some sportsmenship does have be involved to play with another person.

JEST was used for test-driven development.

Clone or fork repo:

only one dependency (prompt-sync) has to be installed and NodeJs is a prerequisite.

`npm install`

cd into the directory and run in the console:

`node index.js`

Follow the on-screen prompts and Enjoy!
